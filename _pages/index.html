    excerpt: "Hi, I’m Chris, a coach who genuinely loves being in the gym and helping others enjoy the process just as much. For me, training has always been about progress, confidence, and joy – not punishment or pressure. Levels is my way of giving back to the community that shaped me, helping every athlete train with purpose, fuel their body well, and reach their next level."
